Mahim Chauhan,5,Brilliant,I switch to ios from android after 10 years so this review might help for migrators It‚Äôs been a month using the iPhone13 and this was my experience 1.

Ratul  Sarkar,5,ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASE OF MINE:),"Pros Outstanding design - sturdy and water-proofed. Bright OLED screen, HDR10, Dolby Vision. Dependable battery life. Loud stereo speakers, excellent output. Unmatched performance, 5G. Great all-round photo and video quality across all three cameras. Cons Minor upgrade over iPhone 12. No 120Hz refresh rate. The notch is still an eyesore even if smaller. The fast charging can be handled better. iOS (with its limitations) remains a love it or leave it affair. READ MORE"
